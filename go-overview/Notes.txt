Go modules is the modern way we use packages in Go. This replaces the old way of using GOPATH with specific folders.

We need to run the following command in a new project to create a go.mod file...

    go mod init github.com/isoment/my-app

We can create a new package by creating a new directory, in this case it is helpers and within that directory all the files
will have the following at the start...

    package helpers

Channels are used to send information form one part of the program to another.

When writing tests in go the tests are in the same location as the files being tested. Go test files must end in _test

    To run all the test in a directory...

        go test -v

    To run a specific test...

        go test -v -run TestDivide ./...

Go has something called table tests, see divide_test.go for how to set this up.

VSCode supports running go tests, click the run icons to the left.

We can check the test coverage of our code...

    go test -cover

For a detailed html printout of test coverage...

    go test -coverprofile=coverage.out && go tool cover -html=coverage.out
